@manpage Expressions

An expression is a sequence of operations that produces a result.

Expressions are formed by combining operators with operands, with the operands themselves being expression (often known as 'sub-expressions').

All expressions have a 'type', for example, the type of the expression '5' is 'Int'. The type of an expression depends on the type of its operands.

The safe member access operator allows you to safely access members of a possibly null object. Accessing a field, property or method of a null object using the plain '.' operator will cause a 'null object runtime error' in debug mode - in release it will likely just crash the program. However, using '?.' instead will cause a null value of the expected type to be returned instead, preventing the runtime error occuring. Note however that this involves some overhead as it means the object must be checked before it is accessed.

The 'Elvis operator' is a binary operator that returns its left hand argument if it is non-null, otherwise it returns its right hand argument. It is similar to 'X<>Null ? X Else Null' except that 'X' is only evaluted once.

@#### Type conversions

The Cast<> operator can be used to convert a value of one type to a value of a different type. The syntax of cast is: `Case<`_Type_`>(`_Expression_`)`.


@#### Type balancing

When evaluating an operator's operands, it is sometimes necessary to adjust the type of one or both operands.

When evaluating the operands of arithemetic or comparison operators, the following rules are used:

* If either operator is String, the other is converted to String.
* Else If either operand is Double, the other is converted to Double.
* Else if either operand is Float, the other is converted to Float.
* Else if either operand is ULong, the other is converted to ULong.
* Else if either operand is Long, the other is converted to Long.
* Else if either operand is unsigned, both are converted to UInt.
* Else both operands are converted to Int.

When evaluating the operands of the `&`, `|` and `^` integer operators, both operands must be integral types and are converted as follows:

* If either operand is ULong, the other is converted to ULong.
* Else if either operand is Long, the other is converted to Long.
* Else if either operand is unsigned, both are converted to UInt.
* Else both operands are converted to Int.

When evaluating the operand of the `Shl` and `Shr` integer operators, the left-hand-side must be an integral type, while the right-hand-side 'shift amount' operand is converted to Int.


@#### Operator overloading

Operator overloading allows you to customize the behavior of the built-in monkey2 operators for classes and structs.

You overload an operator by writing an 'operator method', which is effectively just a special kind of method. Operators must appear inside classes/structs - they cannot currently be 'global'.

Here is a simple example:
<pre>
 Struct Vec2

   Field x:Float
   Field y:Float

   Method New( x:Float,y:Float )
      Self.x=x
      Self.y=y
   End

   Method ToString:String()
      Return "Vec2("+x+","+y+")"
   End

   'Overload the addition operator.
   Operator+:Vec2( rhs:Vec2 )
      Return New Vec2( x+rhs.x,y+rhs.y )
   End

End
</pre>

The 'Operator+' declaration here defines an addition operator for Vec2. This is then used whenever a Vec2 appears as the 'left hand side' of an addition. For example:
<pre>
Function Main()
   Local v1:=New Vec2( 10.0,20.0 )
   Local v2:=New Vec2( 30.0,40.0 )
   Local v3:=v1+v2    'note: calls Operator+ in Vec2.
   Print v3.ToString()
End
</pre>

The following unary operators can be overloaded: `+` `-` `~`

The following binary operators can be overloaded: `*` `/` `Mod` `+` `-` `Shl` `Shr` `&` `|` `~` `=` `<>` `<` `>` `<=` `>=` `<=>`

The following assignment operators can be overloaded: `*=` `/=` `Mod=` `+=` `-=` `Shl=` `Shr=` `&=` `|=` `~=`

Indexing behaviour can also be overloaded using `[]` and `[]=`

Note that you cannot overload `Not`, `And`, `Or` or plain assignment `=`

Operators can return any type of value, and can take any type of value for their 'right hand side' argument(s). However, the precedence of operators cannot be changed.

The `[]` and `[]=` operators allow you to define 'indexing' like behaviour. The `[]` operator is used when an object is indexed, and `[]=` is used when an object is indexed and assigned. Both of these operators can accept any number of parameters of any type. The `[]=` operator requires an additional parameter that is the value to be assigned. This must appear at the end of the parameter list.

Here is an example of some indexing operators for the Vec2 class above:

<pre>
Struct Vec2

   ...as above...

   Operator[]:Float( index:Int )
      Assert( index=0 Or index=1 )
      If index=0 Return x Else Return y
   End

   Operator[]=( index:Int,value:Float )
      Assert( index=0 Or index=1 )
      If index=0 Then x=value Else y=value
   End
End
</pre>

With these additions, you can access Vec2 coordinates 'by index', eg:
<pre>
Function Main()
	Local v:=New Vec2
	v[0]=10.0
	v[1]=20.0
	Print v[0]
	Print v[1]
End
</pre>

You can also overload assignment operators, for example:
<pre>
Struct Vec2

	...as above...
	
	Operator+=( v:Vec2 )
		x+=v.x
		y+=v.y
	End
End
</pre>

If you have already written an Operator+ (as is the case here) this is not strictly necessary, as monkey2 will generate the code for Operator+= for you. However, you may still want to provide a custom version for Operator+= if your code can do so in a more efficient way.
