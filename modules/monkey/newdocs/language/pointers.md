### Pointers

Pointers are special variables containing a memory address.
In Monkey2 pointers are mainly used with external C/C++ code.
Try not to use pointers unless absolutely necessary. It can lead to bugs if the pointed address is not kept "alive". Pointers to globals are safe, for example.  
You must have access to the memory you're trying to reach or you'll have a (fatal) memory access violation.

A pointer can point to any kind of type, even garbage collected types. This can lead to bad things too as the garbage collector is not 'aware' of pointers.

@#### Declarations

Use the `Ptr` keyword to declare a pointer.


```
Local myPtr:int Ptr

Local anotherPtr:Void Ptr
```

@#### Referencing

Use the `VarPtr` operator to reference a pointer

```
Local i:int=1
Local myPtr:int Ptr

myPtr=VarPtr i
```
The myPtr pointer now points to the variable i

@#### Dereferencing with []

You can access the pointed value(s) with the `[]` index operator

```
Local i:int=1
Local myPtr:int Ptr

myPtr=VarPtr i
Print myPtr[0]
```
Will print 1, the value of `i`.
Note you can use pointer arythmetics with the index operator(`[]`) but you have to be sure you have access to that part of the memory or you'll get a memory access violation!

@#### Dereferencing with ->

You can access user defined types fields, methods,.. with the `->` operator. It is equivalent to `[0].`

```
Struct str
	Field i:Int=1
End

Function Main()
   Local s:=New str
   Local strPtr:str Ptr
   strPtr=VarPtr s

   Print strPtr->i
End
```
will show the value of the struct's field `i`

@#### Casting

You can Cast a pointer and do some explicit conversions with the `Cast` operator.

`Cast`<_Type_>(_address_)

An example with a useless conversion from Int to Void to Int:
```
Local i:int=1
Local myVoidPtr:Void Ptr

myVoidPtr=Cast<Void Ptr>(VarPtr i)

Local j:int
Local myIntPtr:Int Ptr

myIntPtr=Cast<Int Ptr>(myVoidPtr)
j=myIntPtr[0]
```
`j` receives the value of `i` but does not have the same address.
`myIntPtr` and `myVoidPtr` both point to the same address (`VarPtr i`) but have different types.
